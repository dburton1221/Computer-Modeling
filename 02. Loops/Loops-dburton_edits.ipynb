    "In this notebook we'll be learning some of the fundamentals of Python loops as they apply to programming in the sciences. In particular simulation, or how by running some code thousands of times, we can determine the expected behavior of a system. In the simplest cases this will be coin flips or dice rolls.\n",
    "\n",
    "New syntactical features of Python will be the $\\texttt{for}$ and the $\\texttt{while}$ loops. Because these are fundamentally structured to *iterate* over data sets, we will have to make up data. To do this, I'll introduce:\n",

    "Below is an example of how to write a $\\texttt{for}$ loop. Let's solve the problem related to *gymnastics judging*. A gymnast's score is determined by a panel of 6 judges who each decide a score between 0.0 and 10.0. The final score is determined by discarding the high and low scores, and averaging the remaining 4. Write a function $\\texttt{gymnastics_score}$ that takes a list of 6 values and prints their average, after throwing out the high and low scores. To do this example, we have to introduce some new ideas in Python:\n",
