# Computer-Modeling
This repository is an archive containing all the gists I posted while doing a computer modeling course in Python.
The instructor was Jesse Johnson, and these are my attempts at solving the problems he made for us to learn from.

What I learned while takign the course can be organized as follows:
01. Functions
02. Loops
03. Lists and Strings
04. Plotting
05. Arrays
06. Command Lines
07. URL Interactions
08. 1D-2D-3D Plotting
09. Final Projects
