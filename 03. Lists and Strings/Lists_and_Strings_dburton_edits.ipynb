    "Write a function ThueMorse that accepts an integer N and returns a string containing the Thue–Morse sequence of order N. The first few strings are 0, 01, 0110, 01101001. Each successive string is obtained by flipping all of the bits of the previous string and concatenating the result to the end of the previous string. The sequence has many amazing properties. For example, it is a binary sequence that is cube-free: it does not contain 000, 111, 010101, or sss where s is any string. It is self-similar: if you delete every other bit, you get another Thue–Morse sequence. It arises in diverse areas of mathematics as well as chess, graphic design, weaving patterns, and music composition."
